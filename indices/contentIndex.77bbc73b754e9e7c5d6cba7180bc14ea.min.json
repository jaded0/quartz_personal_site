Unfortunately, it's like it's rewarding extreme-ness too much.\n\nMaybe my training pattern is wavy because the training process doesn't actually check if a change is effective before making an edit to the weights. A solution could be to create another set of parameters which represent candidate changes, and my imprint only adds to it. Those candidate parameters, with the same shape as the weights of the network, are just added onto them during a run when activations are calculated. Crucially, they're not modifying the weights, yet. Only after we have a reward signal based on the weights+candidate do we add the candidate to the value of the weights as a long-term change, modulated by the reward. Then, we wipe the candidate parameter. \n\nAlternatively, we could just divide the candidate parameter by two or something. When the imprint (activationXactivation) is added to it, the candidate weight change gets a sort of long tail of evaluation. \n\nThe benefit of all this is that a weight change is only applied if it's actually improving the reward. The long tail ought to only help that by requiring it to improve the reward over many iterations.\n","lastmodified":"2024-01-30T16:19:33.917661717Z","tags":["hebbian"]},"/Hebbian-Learning":{"title":"Hebbian Learning","content":" #hebbian \n\nIt's an alternative to backprop that uses only local update rules. It seems far more similar to spiking neural networks in that it tries to follow a more \"fires together, wires together\" paradigm. What's really appealing to me about this weight update mechanism is that it feels more online learning-friendly. I've long wondered why we try to represent short-term memory as activations only, when we know that they ought to have a pathway towards being encoded in the weights. \n\nI think that weight update rules that *never* turn off, even during inference time and in production environments, may be the key to bridging short-term and long-term memory in neural nets. Think, a transformer with no memory limits despite its context length.\n\nI'm aware that this concept has a big history. Biologically-plausible neural net design is a common obsession, but it has mixed results, with current backprop and fully-connected linear networks kinda spitting in its face. So, it seems like a common folly to keep obsessing about trying to get neural nets to behave like my own brain, yet, I can't help but thinking about the local weight update rules in Hebbian learning potentially producing some interesting results in terms of some sort of knowledge retention.\n\n# reading list\n[[Omnivore/2023-08-04/Comparing the performance of Hebbian against backpropagation learning using conv nns|Comparing the performance of Hebbian against backpropagation learning using conv nns]]\n\n[[Omnivore/2023-08-04/Evaluating Hebbian Learning in a Semi-supervised Setting - SpringerLink|Evaluating Hebbian Learning in a Semi-supervised Setting - SpringerLink]]","lastmodified":"2024-01-30T16:19:33.917661717Z","tags":["hebbian"]},"/Omnivore/2023-08-04/Comparing-the-performance-of-Hebbian-against-backpropagation-learning-using-conv-nns":{"title":"Comparing the performance of Hebbian against backpropagation learning using conv nns","content":"\n\n# Comparing the performance of Hebbian against backpropagation learning using conv nns\n#Omnivore\n #hebbian \n  \n[Read on Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/me/comparing-the-performance-of-hebbian-against-backpropagation-lea-189c2643103)\n\n[Read Original](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00521-021-06701-4)\n\n## Highlights\n\n\u003e The results on various datasets are compared with those obtained by unsupervised VAE, and the potentials and limitations of the methods are highlighted; we also deemed interesting to report the results of supervised backprop training in our discussion; [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/comparing-the-performance-of-hebbian-against-backpropagation-lea-189c2643103#02caac6f-8b80-42ad-b10e-c702f4ee120e)  ^02caac6f\n\n\u003e Pros of Hebbian learning:\n\u003e \n\u003e * Effective for training low-level feature extractors;\n\u003e * Produces better features than VAE for the classification task;\n\u003e * Effective for re-training higher network layers in fewer epochs than other approaches;\n\u003e * Some hybrid combinations of Hebbian and backprop help improving performance in some cases, as can be observed in Appendix [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00521-021-06701-4#Sec33);\n\u003e \n\u003e Cons of Hebbian learning:\n\u003e \n\u003e * Not effective for training intermediate layers;\n\u003e * Even though HPCA provides a reduction in the gap between unsupervised and supervised methods, the latter are still preferable for end-to-end network training;\n\u003e * Finding the best combination of Hebbian and backprop layers is not immediate and requires exploring various network configurations.

I'd like an automatic tool for it, that can show it to me in a visual structure. \n\n# Tools\n- PyCG generates call graphs for Python code using static analysis. It efficiently supports Higher order functions Twisted class inheritance schemes Automatic discovery of imported modules for further analysis Nested definitions \n- Graphviz, especially dot files.\n- a javascript package can animate between different generated dot files: [GitHub - magjac/d3-graphviz: Graphviz DOT rendering and animated transitions using D3](https://github.com/magjac/d3-graphviz)\n- Python package for generating dot files: [GitHub - stricaud/gvgen: Graphviz Python dot generator](https://github.com/stricaud/gvgen)\n- The `ast` module is pretty cool, too, because with it, I can get function names with their corresponding code. Not only that, I can also get the content of for loops and if/then statements. \n# possible outline\n1. Get PyCG call graphs for the project.\n2. Create dot files from call graph.\n3. Grab function-code pairs, as well as control flow data, from ast.\n4. Include the relevant code into the functions in the dot files. \n5. Create subgraphs in the dot files, corresponding to control flow logic within the functions.\n6. Remap function calls from between function-function to between subgraph function call-function.\n7. Run functions and parts of functions through OpenAI API to get summaries, and add the summaries to the nodes in the dot file.\n8. Create visualization from the dot file with javascript package.\n9. One of two things:\n\t-  Create tree-like structure to allow for hiding/revealing of nodes, code sections, and summaries.\n\t- Somehow create on-click handlers for elements on the visualization to allow for more hands-on hiding and revealing of elements?\n# Generated project plan:\n\nYour idea sounds fantastic! Let's break down the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. **Parse the Python Codebase**: Use PyCG to parse the python codebase. This will allow you to generate the required static analysis data.\n\n2. **Generate Graph Data**: Convert the data you get from PyCG into a format that's suitable for visualization. You would likely want a node-link structure. Each function, class, or module can be a node, and the links can represent calls, inheritances, etc.\n\n3. **Visualize with Graphviz**: Use Graphviz, especially the DOT language, to create an initial visualization of the graph data. This serves as your first prototype.\n\n4. **Interactive Features**:\n    - **Zoom and Pan**: Use a tool or framework like D3.js to make the visualization interactive. D3.js allows you to zoom, pan, and manipulate the SVG elements easily.\n    - **Collapse and Hide Sections**: This can be implemented by adding interactivity where certain nodes or groups of nodes can be collapsed or expanded. Again, D3.js is perfect for this.\n    - **2D/3D Space**: If you want a 3D representation, consider using Three.js.\n\n5. **Code and Summaries**:\n    - **Displaying Code**: When a user clicks or hovers over a node, display the associated code snippet in a pop-up or a side panel.\n    - **AI-Augmented Summaries**: Use GPT-4 API to summarize the code sections. When a user interacts with a node, the AI can provide a brief, human-readable summary of what that function/class/module does.\n\n6. **Automatic Collapsing**: \n    - Use metrics such as function length, complexity, or the number of internal function calls as parameters. Functions or modules with low complexity could be collapsed by default, or you could use the GPT-4 model to predict which sections are less relevant and collapse them.\n\n7. **User Interface**: Create an intuitive UI where users can interact with the graph, navigate through it, and get insights about the codebase.\n\n8. **Continuous Updates**:\n    - **File Watcher**: Implement a file watcher to detect changes in the codebase. When a file changes, you can re-analyze and update the visualization in real-time.\n\n9. **Additional Features**:\n    - **Search \u0026 Highlight**: Allow users to search for specific functions, classes, or variables and highlight them in the graph.\n    - **Dependencies**: Show external module dependencies and how they are used in the codebase.\n\n10. **Deployment \u0026 Scaling**: Consider whether this tool will be web-based, a standalone application, or a plugin for an IDE. Also, consider scalability if you want to analyze large codebases.\n\nBuilding this would be a significant project, but the outcome could be an incredibly useful tool for developers. The combination of visualizing code relationships and having AI-powered insights could redefine the way developers explore and understand codebases. Best of luck with your project!\n\n## implementation\nI asked about how the output of pycg could be used, as well as pulling out code to send to LLMs:\n\nThe data snippet you've shared is a representation of how functions/modules (the keys) relate to other functions/modules (the values in the list) in the form of a call graph.\n\nTo focus on functions defined within a specific directory:\n\n1. **Filter by Prefix**: One approach is to use a naming convention that includes the module's path, then filter keys based on that prefix.\n\n   ```python\n   directory_prefix = \"entity_extraction_module.relationship_extraction\"\n   filtered_data = {key: value for key, value in pycg_data.items() if key.startswith(directory_prefix)}\n   ```\n\n   This way, you only retain function calls that are inside the given directory/module. However, note that if external modules/functions are called from within your target directory, they'll still appear in the lists but won't have their own keys.\n\n2. **Collect Function Definitions**: To retrieve the actual content of the functions, you'd need to use another tool or library that's able to parse the Python code and extract function definitions. A library like `ast` (Abstract Syntax Tree) that's built into Python can be quite useful for this.\n\n   Here's a simple way to grab the content of functions using the `ast` module:\n\n   ```python\n   import ast\n\n   class FunctionVisitor(ast.NodeVisitor):\n       def __init__(self):\n           self.function_data = {}\n\n       def visit_FunctionDef(self, node):\n           source_code = ast.get_source_segment(code, node)  # code is the source code of the file as a string\n           self.function_data[node.name] = source_code\n           self.generic_visit(node)\n\n   with open('your_script_path.py', 'r') as file:\n       code = file.read()\n       tree = ast.parse(code)\n       visitor = FunctionVisitor()\n       visitor.visit(tree)\n       # Now, visitor.function_data contains function names as keys and their source code as values.\n   ```\n\n   For the above to work, you need to have the entire codebase as strings. If you have a directory, loop through each file and process them one by one.\n\n3. **Integration with GPT-4**: Once you have extracted the function content, you can pass it to GPT-4 for further processing, summarization, or any other operation you're interested in.\n\nAlways remember to handle any potential exceptions or issues, like file access errors or AST parsing errors. And depending on the size of the codebase, extracting and processing function definitions might take some time, so consider implementing some caching or other optimization techniques as necessary.","lastmodified":"2024-01-30T16:19:33.917661717Z","tags":["project","python"]},"/private/notes/CJK-+-Latex-Support-%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95":{"title":"CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)","content":"\n## Chinese, Japanese, Korean Support\nÂá†‰πéÂú®Êàë‰ª¨ÊÑèËØÜÂà∞‰πãÂâçÔºåÊàë‰ª¨Â∑≤ÁªèÁ¶ªÂºÄ‰∫ÜÂú∞Èù¢„ÄÇ\n\nÏö∞Î¶¨Í∞Ä Í∑∏Í≤ÉÏùÑ ÏïåÍ∏∞ÎèÑ Ï†ÑÏóê Ïö∞Î¶¨Îäî ÎïÖÏùÑ Îñ†ÎÇ¨ÏäµÎãàÎã§.\n\nÁßÅ„Åü„Å°„Åå„Åù„Çå„ÇíÁü•„Çã„Åª„ÅºÂâç„Å´„ÄÅÁßÅ„Åü„Å°„ÅØÂú∞Èù¢„ÇíÈõ¢„Çå„Å¶„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åó„Åü„ÄÇ\n\n## Latex\n\nBlock math works with two dollar signs `$$...$$`\n\n$$f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\n    f\\hat(\\xi),e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x}\n    \\,d\\xi$$\n\t\nInline math also works with single dollar signs `$...$`.

The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/).

Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile # again, (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nüêõ [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)\n","lastmodified":"2024-01-30T16:19:33.921661734Z","tags":[]},"/private/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
