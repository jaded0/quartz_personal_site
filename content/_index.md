I work with the door open. I'll update this site with every little project and research tangent, hopefully giving those who want to work with me a sort of transcript to go off of. 

Please talk to Jaden-Bot! It's on the bottom-right corner, and knows a lot about me. 
If you want to work with me, call or text: (385) 327-2503
## current status
- Considering grad schools to study deep learning. 
- Reading about [hebbian](Hebbian%20Learning.md) gradient update rules.
- Finishing an internship building document understanding for life science methods documents.


### side projects
- Revisiting an old experment; I wanted to [augment WLASL](Augment%20WLASL.md) -- a word-level American Sign Language dataset -- by running it through some stable diffusion models, perhaps guided by ControlNet. I have some proximity to the Deaf community, so I may be able to get some feedback on the results.
- Just built a chatbot on this site to allow people to interview "me" on-demand.
- Considering some sort of [[Visualize a Codebase]] system, allowing me to more quickly understand what's going on in open source projects. 

## goals
I really just want to work on new AI models.
