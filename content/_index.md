I work with the door open. I'll update this site with every little project and research tangent, hopefully giving those who want to work with me a sort of live transcript to go off of. 

Please talk to Jaden-Bot! It's on the bottom-right corner, and knows a lot about me. 
If you want to work with me, call or text: (385) 327-2503
## current status
- Choosing grad schools to study deep learning. 
- Researching [hebbian](Hebbian%20Learning.md) gradient update rules. I'm building an RNN that uses [[List of Hebbian Weight Update Rules|local learning rules]], hoping that, as an emergent behavior, it will encode medium-term "memories" within the weights themselves. 
- Check out the [report](https://wandb.ai/jadens_team/hebby/reports/prog--Vmlldzo2ODQxMzQ0) that benchmarks various local weight update rules. If you have any idea why they all seem to be converging to that arbitrary value, please email me!
- Researching [[patient record model type breakdown|patient trajectory embeddings]] for use in case control studies at a children's hospital. I get paid for this one!

### side projects
- Slowly building up [Convostarter](https://www.convostarter.app/), an app for language learning. 

### backburner
- Revisiting an old experment; I wanted to [augment WLASL](Augment%20WLASL.md) -- a word-level American Sign Language dataset -- by running it through some stable diffusion models, perhaps guided by ControlNet. I have some proximity to the Deaf community, so I may be able to get some feedback on the results.
- Considering some sort of [[Visualize a Codebase]] system, allowing me to more quickly understand what's going on in open source projects. 

### finished projects
- Just built a chatbot on this site to allow people to interview "me" on-demand.
- An internship building document understanding for life science methods documents.
## goals
I really just want to work on new AI models.
