I work with the door open. I'll update this site with every little project and research tangent, hopefully giving those who want to work with me a sort of transcript to go off of.

## current status
- Considering grad schools to study deep learning. 
- Reading about [hebbian](site/Hebbian%20Learning.md) gradient update rules.
- Finishing an internship building document understanding for life science methods documents.

## goals
I really just want to work on new AI models.
