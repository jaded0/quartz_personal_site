[[List of Hebbian Weight Update Rules#ABCD|ABCD]], again. Just the same as [[zotero_notes/hebbian/meta-learning-through-hebbian-plasticity-KG2BPTBB#^5c0f88|meta-learning-through-hebbian-plasticity-KG2BPTBB]]
The point in this one was to reduce the number of rules while also increasing generalizability. Simply superior.

It's cool how they are very indirectly training the network. The parameters aren't really the weights, but the plasticity parameters. Very neat.
