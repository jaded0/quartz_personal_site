## Highlights

> The results on various datasets are compared with those obtained by unsupervised VAE, and the potentials and limitations of the methods are highlighted; we also deemed interesting to report the results of supervised backprop training in our discussion; [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/comparing-the-performance-of-hebbian-against-backpropagation-lea-189c2643103#02caac6f-8b80-42ad-b10e-c702f4ee120e)  ^02caac6f

> Pros of Hebbian learning:
> 
> * Effective for training low-level feature extractors;
> * Produces better features than VAE for the classification task;
> * Effective for re-training higher network layers in fewer epochs than other approaches;
> * Some hybrid combinations of Hebbian and backprop help improving performance in some cases, as can be observed in Appendix [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00521-021-06701-4#Sec33);
> 
> Cons of Hebbian learning:
> 
> * Not effective for training intermediate layers;
> * Even though HPCA provides a reduction in the gap between unsupervised and supervised methods, the latter are still preferable for end-to-end network training;
> * Finding the best combination of Hebbian and backprop layers is not immediate and requires exploring various network configurations. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/comparing-the-performance-of-hebbian-against-backpropagation-lea-189c2643103#2fb11229-5007-48de-a177-4055ad5da22b)  ^2fb11229

> our results suggest that the Hebbian approach is suitable for training early feature extraction layers or to re-train the final layers of a pre-trained deep neural network, requiring fewer training epochs than other methods.

> Hebbian approaches outperform VAE training [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/comparing-the-performance-of-hebbian-against-backpropagation-lea-189c2643103#e0d3b015-3325-44a2-b4ee-2f5b2e82f965)  ^e0d3b015
